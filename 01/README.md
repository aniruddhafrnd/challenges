Read in dictionary.txt (provided, just a copy of /usr/share/dict/words of my Mac) and calculate the word that has the most value in Scrabble based on LETTER_SCORES which is imported from data.py in wordvalue-template.py. 
 Make sure you run the test_wordvalue.py to verify your methods are correct. 
 
It expects (imports) wordvalue.py so make sure you copy wordvalue-template.py to wordvalue.py
 Note that no PyPI modules need to be installed, just use stdlib for this. 
 Bonus: something to think about: when calculating the max value can you use a fast builtin method? And even so could you improve the performance even further?
